<h1 class="pb-3 text-center">Website Projects — Powered by eBlack Diamond</h1>

<div class="col-12">
<p class="lead fs-4">Congratulations on initiating a project for your new website or enterprise application. You have done your research, compared options, evaluated cost, and ready to take action to make this website represent your online identity, and provide a return on investment.</p>
<p class="fs-5">eBlack Diamond knows that choosing the right partner for your project goes beyond technical expertise, it is also about their process and ability to deliver a functional solution on time and within budget.</p>
<p class="fs-5">That is why eBlack Diamond follows a phased approach based on Project Management Institute (PMI) techniques to manage every project regardless of the size or scope. By using this framework, we ensure clear resource allocation, stakeholder alignment, and predictable delivery for every client.</p>

<h2>Phase 1: Planning</h2>
<p class="fs-5">Phase one begins with a project kick off. This is the start of the project where eBlack Diamond and the customer review the Statement of Work (SOW), analyze the business case, and identify the key resources dedicated to the project. Understanding the budget and schedule requirements, we will plan the implementation. </p>
<p class="fs-5">Our key activities during this phase include:</p>
<ul>
<li class="fs-5"><b>Solution Design:</b> Visualize site flow with diagrams and mockups for clarity.</li>
<li class="fs-5"><b>Content Strategy:</b> Copywriting, search engine optimization (SEO), and gathering data and media assets.</li>
<li class="fs-5"><b>Project Management:</b> Configuration checklist, communication methods, and schedule.</li><a name="phase2"></a>
</ul>
<p class="fs-5">To complete the planning phase, we will review the mockup, copywriting, and project management documents with stakeholders. We will develop a project timeline and configuration checklist to identify items needed to establish a target go-live date. Any customized features will be included in the configuration checklist. If building an ecommerce store, the go live date will be when orders can be placed online using the website.</p>
<p class="fs-5">Phase 1 ends with the approval of the mockup and project materials. This planning period ensures that expectations regarding design, copy, and timeline are agreed upon, eliminating ambiguity, and preventing scope creep later in the process.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Phase 2: Build</h2>
<p class="fs-5">During the Build Phase eBlack Diamond brings the approved concepts to life. This process begins with foundational setup: creating accounts, procuring licenses, domain name registration, and integrations with existing applications. While we configure the solution, we maintain regular checkpoints and provide periodic updates to relay progress. </p>
<p class="fs-5">Our building process focuses on two key areas:</p>
<ol>
<li class="fs-5"><b>User Experience (UX) & Responsiveness:</b> We build features and content optimized for multiple device resolutions. Whether a user is on a mobile phone, tablet, or desktop, the website, including navigation menus, carousels, and forms will adapt dynamically to provide the best possible experience.</li>
<li class="fs-5"><b>E-Commerce Configuration: </b>For online retail projects, we configure market segments, product catalogs, and tax rates. We also build shipping logic and configure tiers for weight, size, and carrier (UPS, USPS, FED EX, etc.), and integrate payment gateways. We configure and test this by conducting end-to-end simulated transactions.</li>
</ol>
<p class="fs-5">To prepare for the transition to the next phase, eBlack Diamond develops Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) for clients’ power users and drafts user test scenarios. Phase 2 concludes when the site has passed our internal QA.  The solution is configured, tested, and go-live ready in a staged environment for client presentation.</p>
<hr>
<div class="col-12 text-center py-4"> <img src="images/timeline.jpg" atl="project management methodology" class="img-fluid rounded"><a name="phase3"></a>
</div>
<hr>
<h2>Phase 3: Validate</h2>
<p class="fs-5">In this phase, we introduce the client to the finished product. While the visual identity will mirror the approved mockups, the dynamic site will now feature the interactive elements and animations that enhance the overall user experience. </p>
<p class="fs-5">This phase is critical for quality assurance and training. Our process includes:</p><a name="phase4"></a>
<ul>
<li class="fs-5"><b>Demo & Training: </b>We review all items from the configuration checklist. For complex projects, such as e-commerce solutions, we schedule dedicated training sessions to ensure the customer is comfortable with back-end management.</li>
<li class="fs-5"><b>User Acceptance Testing (UAT): </b>eBlack Diamond provides a recommended set of testing scenarios.  This UAT must be completed by the customer to ensure that the delivered product meets the expected result.</li>
<li class="fs-5"><b>Issue Resolution: </b>As issues are discovered during testing, we provide a clear, standardized method for submitting and tracking them. We remain actively engaged to resolve these matters quickly.</li>
</ul>
<p class="fs-5">Phase 3 is completed once all necessary edits are made, configuration updates are finalized, and testing is concluded. Final approval from the client and the site can go live. </p>
<hr>

<h2>Phase 4: Launch</h2>
<p class="fs-5">The Launch Phase marks the culmination of the project, where the staged environment is migrated to production and opened to the public or client end users if deploying an enterprise application.</p>
<p class="fs-5">The cut-over will vary depending on the scope of the project. For a standard informational or marketing website it may be a quick flip the switch to public viewing. For complex e-commerce or enterprise solutions, this involves a carefully orchestrated migration of data and services to the live environment.  Regardless of complexity, our primary goal is executing the go-live on the target date established during the planning phase.</p>
<p class="fs-5">Following the launch, we conduct a project retrospective. Any variations from the schedule, whether ahead or behind, are reviewed as lessons learned to update organization process assets, and project documents, ensuring our process gets sharper with every project we deliver.</p>
<hr>

<h2>Post-Launch Support - A Continued Partnership</h2>
<p class="fs-5">While the project is complete, your partnership with eBlack Diamond has just begun. We transition from implementation to ongoing maintenance, handling periodic updates, new content uploads, and subscription and domain name management. As you move from the project to normal operations of your website or enterprise application, eBlack Diamond is here to support your vision, and maintain your online profile. </p>
<p class="fs-5">By utilizing a consistent PMI-based methodology, eBlack Diamond guarantees a transparent process with full stakeholder alignment. This structured approach is the key to minimizing risk, maximizing quality, and ensuring the long-term success of your website or enterprise application.</p>
